I'm terrible at vhdl and understood what 
synthetizable means fairly late into the project. 

We're rewritting everything in here as synthetizable vhdl code for 
the CR. 


MEM and FETCH are given. 
each dir will contain the vhdl files associated with 
the level of the pipeline. 

the test bench dir contains every single test bench file. 

The test bench files that we already wrote will not be 
rewritten (except if they are incorrect of course). 

the fifo files were given.  

the old version of exe and reg were working but will be 
redone. We didn't have time to write the full reg automata 
so the version contained here will be the first one that 
we do.
